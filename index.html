This paper investigates the fallout from the failures of Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft during its first manned
    mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The mission, which took place in June, revealed critical
    faults that had previously gone undetected during in-flight testing. This analysis examines the technical
    issues behind the spacecraft’s failure, particularly the malfunctioning thrusters, and explores how the 
    rushed development process contributed to these flaws. Additionally, the paper predicts the potential 
    implications for Boeing’s reputation, the safety of commercial space travel, and the long-term consequences
    for Boeing’s involvement in NASA’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP). The findings suggest that, while the Starliner
    incident did not result in fatalities, it highlights significant engineering flaws that could jeopardize Boeing’s
    future in the space industry if corrective actions are not taken.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<pre id="Introduction_InText"class="ex1">
Space is a domain many would wish to enter, and with the logistics of commercialised travel becoming an ever more 
    fore-coming reality it is vital companies affiliated with NASAs Commercial Crew Program (CCP)
    are creating a safe, reliable infrastructure to eventually make commercial, non-scientific interstellar journeys.
    This paper analyses the failures of Boeing, one of the select private companies affiliated
    with the governmental organisation NASA’s CCP <a href="#References">(CST-100 Starliner (no date))</a> whose latest capsule series malfunctioned
    on its first manned trip to the International Space Centre (ISS), leading to two astronauts
    being trapped in space. The causes of these failures, their impact on the mission, and the long-term consequences.

Main article:
NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore were the two crew members of Boeings first commercial spaceship model:
    The Starliner. It was sent to the ISS on the fifth of June 2024, where faults that were not
    detected during testing were discovered. From launch, some helium was found to be leaking, of which the rate of
    increased during flight. In addition, a malfunction in the 5 out of the total 28 thrusters lead
    to an hour-long delay in the docking sequence to the station. The cause was unexplainable as well at first, and
    even in orbit testing no direct cause could be found for these faults. <a href="#References">(Chow, D. and Carman, J. (2024)</a>
    it was debated whether it would be safe to return withe capsule however the uncertainty that more errors could form
    were too high to safely allow the pair to return. The capsule was ejected autonomously in
    September. This was a sensible choice as thruster errors occurred again as well as a navigation blackout <a href="#References">(Heracleous, L. 2024)</a>. 

A grounded test conducted research at the White Sands Test Facility New Mexico on an engine and thruster set, of which
    was subjected it to similar conditions of the one in orbit. From their tests 27 out of the 28
    thrusters performed poorly as shown in figure 1 below.  This concluded that the cause for the malfunction on the
    Starliner was caused by a tear in a Teflon seal which swelled pressure and heat, <a href="#References">(Chow, D. and Carman, J. (2024))</a>. This would block the flow of expelling propellant gas from inside the thruster,
    affecting the magnitude and the direction of the motion of the capsule. Materials used in
    thrusters must be able to withstand very high temperatures of over 3500K without their physical form changing much
    and still retaining their structural integrity.

<a href="#References">(Chow, D. and Carman, J. (2024))</a>

Thrusters:
The theory and science of how thrusters work is based on Newtons third law motion, which states that for every action force
    applied there is an equal and opposite reaction.
    Engineers created thrusters which accelerate mass out of controlled nozzles, propelling spacecraft through a medium by
    applying the ‘control force’ of expulsion in the opposite direction of desired travel.
    <a href="#References">(Colagrossi, A. et.al, 2023)</a> These are not only useful for general propulsion through vacuums and high altitudes but also
    especially vital for small trim movements in docking and undocking sequences onto
    larger bodies such as the International Space Station. 

The Starliner:
The Starliner engineering project was largely over budget and its development process was far behind compared to its estimated
    deadlines. These rushed procedures are what allowed small errors to form in various
    systems in the capsule. This resulted in the 2 astronauts being forced to remain in space for an additional 6 months where
    they will be taken back aboard the Space X Crew Dragon 9 capsule in February 2025.
    Meanwhile, on Earth Boeings public image and the integrity of its engineering reputation have only worsened, being the
    latest in a long series of disasters such as the emergency door of a 737 max 9 blowing out
    earlier in January 2024 and the two fatal crashes of their 737 Max aircrafts. <a href="#References">(Heracleous, L. 2024)</a>. Altogether this leads
    to the credibility of the company to provide safe and reliable spacecraft and aircraft
    to be highly doubted and maybe even a possible removal from the CCP altogether.

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<pre id="Conclusion_InText"class="ex1">
  
  To Conclude, this incident is the latest in a series of failures on behalf of the Boeing company that show how its rushed
    work led to many major flaws. It is worth noting, although the Starliner
    did not lead to fatalities, the potential risks that going to space posed, it would have led to the largest fallout and
    likely ended their contract with NASA’s CCP. Both the helium leaks and the thruster
    faults could have easily led to the capsule not docking onto the Space Station, trapping the two astronauts in the vacuum
    of space. Providing Boeing continues the Starliner programme, we can only hope that
    the issues clearly revealed on this capsule will be solved and refined before the next model is finalised or the likelihood
    that Boeing will be involved in the future of commercialised space travel is extremely
    low, leaving just Elon Musk’s Space X on contract.
